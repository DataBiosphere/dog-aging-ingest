Scooter barks a lot. If he wants to go out and I don't let him, because he's always barking at the door, he gets Muffy. He rarely goes out without her. If Scooter goes out with Muffy and doesn't pee right away, I send him back out. Muffy will go back outside so he will follow her and wait until he pees. She seems to have begun watching out for him, like an older sibling would but they're not related and she's 5 years younger. We got them from a rescue shelter. The previous owner got Muffy, who was a puppy to be company for Scooter. "}
